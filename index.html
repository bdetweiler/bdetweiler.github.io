        <h3>
            Onward!
        </h3>
        <p>
            I once found some wise words in a <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2722">web comic</a>. 
            I read this cartoon years ago, but the concept has since lingered in the back of my head.
            The idea is that it takes seven years to master something, so assuming we are lucky enough to live into our middle to late ages, 
            we have several opportunities to reinvent ourselves and master new things. The author divides each of these 
            seven years into discrete time intervals he describes as <i>lifetimes</i>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking the author's idea literally, I have spent my last two <i>lifetimes</i> on computer science and software engineering. 
            That is not to say that I have mastered those subjects by any means. Very few will ever master such topics, and even if they
            do, there is always more to be discovered. However, I do feel <i>comfortable</i> in these fields. 
            And with that comfort there is an underlying uneasiness. A sort of nervousness perpetuated by complacency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Comfort leads to rust. An idle mind atrophies. But there is catharsis in the pursuit of knowledge. 
            The curious may wander, but they are never lost. And so with that, I turn away from the comfortable, familiar surroundings
            of software engineering, and into the cold unknown darkness of Data Science.
