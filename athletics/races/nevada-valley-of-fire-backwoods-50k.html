          Recap
        </h3>
        <p>
          I had originally signed up for the Marathon distance and decided to upgrade to the 50K.
          I had been dealing with Achilles tendinopathy, but most recently felt like there might be a
          slight stress fracture around the first and second metatarsals on my left foot. 
          I'm a stubborn one, as runners tend to be, so I decided to run anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air was cold and crisp in the mid-30s, but knowing it was going to heat up to the 60s by the end,
          I opted to only wear arm sleeves and gloves and no jacket. This was a good choice as I only endured about an
          hour of cold before it started to get warm enough to cause sweat.
          The race started at 7:00 AM, so there was no need for headlamps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming out of the start, we descended into the valley. The first section was smooth, uneven rock that I had
          some difficulty with due to the stress fracture. Only able to touch gingerly on my left foot, I didn't
          attack that downhill as hard as I wanted. I decided I wanted to keep an average pace of 8:30, so
          I tried not to overdo it on the outset, but I ended up going out at the back of the front pack, which was
          decidedly too fast. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I was able to hold my pace for about 15 miles before a noticeable degradation hit my form and stride. 
          By mile 20, I got hit with the run-walks. Miles 25-27, I picked it back up for a slow jog. From 27 on,
          I was dragging pretty hard. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The course itself was not super challenging, except for the rocks and sand. Sand saps your energy and
          deals a mental blow as you expend more effort to go even slower. The rocks were primarily a concern for
          my stress fracture. Thankfully, I made it through with no further injuries. The results really highlight
          my lack of preperation. I was a better runner in my mind than I was on the trail. This is a recurring theme
          on these longer distance runs. I tend to overestimate my ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          This being my first 50K distance, I wanted to take with me a mindset of "time not distance" to keep myself from
          being intimidated. This worked well for most of the race, but once again, I overestimated myself and thought 
          I would be done in probably 4:30, or 5 hours at
          the latest. When 5 hours rolled around and I saw the 5K turnaround point (meaning I had 1.5 miles to go), I got
          a little frustrated. This could have been avoided by setting my expectations a little beyond what I expected myself
          to do. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, while I was disappointed in my effort, I enjoyed the race. It was beautifully scenic and the
          runners were friendly and uplifting.
